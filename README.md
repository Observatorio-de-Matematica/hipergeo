DESCRIPTION
===========

Hypergeometric package for Maxima featuring:
- Sister Celine implementation;
- friendly link to Gosper implementation from `zeilberger' package;
- Builds full recurrence from Zeilberger's algorithm;
- WZ and WZ certificate implementation.

Please, refer to "A=B" (Petkovsek, Wilf, Zeilberger) book for algorithms.

Moreover, you can refer to `documentation-pt\_BR.pdf' for portuguese
documentation. Here, you have practical introduction to hypergeometric
summation 100% Maxima-oriented with some level of deepness on the algorithms
throughout the text.


LOADING
=======

In Maxima, type

> load('hipergeo.mac');

in order to load the package.


TODO
====

- Build a standard Maxima package.
- Fix WZ.
